# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#     ghostty +list-fonts
font-family = JetBrains Mono
font-family-italic = "Maple Mono"

# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc. Note that you may still not see the change
# depending on your `window-inherit-font-size` setting. If that setting is
# true, only the first window will be affected by this change since all
# subsequent windows will inherit the font size of the previous window.
font-size = 22.0

# Theme in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes.

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the cursor. A value of 1
# is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value. Note that a
# sufficiently small value such as 0.3 may be effectively invisible and may
# make it difficult to find the cursor.
cursor-opacity = 0.8

# Start new windows in fullscreen. This setting applies to new windows and
# does not apply to tabs, splits, etc. However, this setting will apply to all
# new windows, not just the first one.
# 
# On macOS, this setting does not work if window-decoration is set to
# "false", because native fullscreen on macOS requires window decorations
# to be set.
fullscreen = true

# The "toggle_window_decoration" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime.
# 
# Changing this configuration in your configuration and reloading will
# only affect new windows. Existing windows will not be affected.
# 
# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.

# Whether to enable shell integration auto-injection or not. Shell integration
# greatly enhances the terminal experience by enabling a number of features:
# 
#   * Working directory reporting so new tabs, splits inherit the
#     previous terminal's working directory.
# 
#   * Prompt marking that enables the "jump_to_prompt" keybinding.
# 
#   * If you're sitting at a prompt, closing a terminal will not ask
#     for confirmation.
# 
#   * Resizing the window with a complex prompt usually paints much
#     better.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `none` - Do not do any automatic injection. You can still manually
#     configure your shell to enable the integration.
# 
#   * `detect` - Detect the shell based on the filename.
# 
#   * `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `zsh` - Use this specific shell injection scheme.
# 
# The default value is `detect`.
shell-integration = detect

# macOS doesn't have a distinct "alt" key and instead has the "option"
# key which behaves slightly differently. On macOS by default, the
# option key plus a character will sometimes produces a Unicode character.
# For example, on US standard layouts option-b produces "âˆ«". This may be
# undesirable if you want to use "option" as an "alt" key for keybindings
# in terminal programs or shells.
# 
# This configuration lets you change the behavior so that option is treated
# as alt.
macos-option-as-alt = true

# This will be used to set the `TERM` environment variable.
# HACK: We set this with an `xterm` prefix because vim uses that to enable key
# protocols (specifically this will enable `modifyOtherKeys`), among other
# features. An option exists in vim to modify this: `:set
# keyprotocol=ghostty:kitty`, however a bug in the implementation prevents it
# from working properly. https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/13211 fixes this.

# Control the auto-update functionality of Ghostty. This is only supported
# on macOS currently, since Linux builds are distributed via package
# managers that are not centrally controlled by Ghostty.
# 
# Checking or downloading an update does not send any information to
# the project beyond standard network information mandated by the
# underlying protocols. To put it another way: Ghostty doesn't explicitly
# add any tracking to the update process. The update process works by
# downloading information about the latest version and comparing it
# client-side to the current version.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `off` - Disable auto-updates.
#  * `check` - Check for updates and notify the user if an update is
#    available, but do not automatically download or install the update.
#  * `download` - Check for updates, automatically download the update,
#    notify the user, but do not automatically install the update.
# 
# The default value is `check`.
# 
# Changing this value at runtime works after a small delay.
